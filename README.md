# HotCornersWin
Add MacOS hot corners function to Windows 10!

![Settings window and the notification area icon](https://github.com/flexits/HotCornersWin/assets/86118729/2d07e3f8-544d-4120-8bb4-cc5b4d2a64f1)


A simple notification area application allows user to choose from a list of various actions to be triggered when the mouse cursor hits a corner of the screen. Of course, one can choose independent action for different corners or leave some without an action at all. Multi-monitor environments are supported as well, with customizable placing of the hot corners.

Double-click on the app's icon turns the application on and off.

### Installation and usage
Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/flexits/HotCornersWin/releases) page and run the installer. The app will be added to the current user's StartUp folder in Start->Programs.

### TODO list:
