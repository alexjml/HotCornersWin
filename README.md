# HotCornersWin
Add MacOS hot corners function to Windows 10!

![Settings window and the notification area icon](https://github.com/flexits/HotCornersWin/assets/86118729/fb4171d3-2729-4c53-8fdc-d5411905d51e)


A simple notification area application allows user to choose from a list of various actions to be triggered when the mouse cursor hits a corner of the screen. Of course, one can choose independent action for different corners or leave some without an action at all. Multi-monitor environments are supported as well, with customizable placing of the hot corners.

Double-click on the app's icon turns the application on and off. Additionally, the app is capable of turning itsels off when something enters a fullscreen mode and turning back on afterwards.

### Installation and usage
Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/flexits/HotCornersWin/releases) page and run the installer. The app will be added to the current user's StartUp folder in Start->Programs.

### Available actions:
* Start menu

### TODO list:
* Ignore actions if mouse button is pressed (on dragging) — implemented, needs testing
* Auto-disable if a full-screen app is running — implemented, needs testing
* [Adjustable delay before triggering an action](https://github.com/flexits/HotCornersWin/issues/4) (set separately for different corners)
* Custom actions ([commands](https://github.com/flexits/HotCornersWin/issues/5) and [hotkeys](https://github.com/flexits/HotCornersWin/issues/6))
* Manage startup in the app's [settings](https://github.com/flexits/HotCornersWin/issues/7)
* Looks terrible under Win11 — [move to WinUI 3](https://github.com/flexits/HotCornersWin/issues/8)
* feel free to add yours...
